I am a decision scientist and religious studies PhD living in Decatur, Georgia. I am an experienced researcher, [writer](/writing-editing/), editor, teacher, and project manager. I currently work at an analytics and AI consultancy (all views are my own).

Prior to moving to Georgia, I spent five years as a project manager at an internationally operating, progressive non-profit institution for civic education. My primary responsibilities concerned socio-ecological transformation, particularly in relationship to the Global South.

My educational background is in South Asian religious studies and culminated in a PhD. Read more about my dissertation and scholarly publications on my [research](/research/) page.
