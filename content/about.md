I am an aspiring data scientist and religious studies PhD living in Decatur, Georgia. I am an experienced researcher, writer, editor, and project manager.

Prior to moving to Georgia, I spent five years as a project manager at the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung’s New York office. RLS is a democratic socialist political education foundation closely affiliated with Germany’s Left Party. My primary responsibilities concerned socio-ecological transformation, particularly in relationship to the Global South, but I also worked on a variety of issues of concern to the European and North American Left.

My educational background is in South Asian religious studies and culminated in a PhD from Columbia University. Read more about my dissertation and scholarly publications on my [research](/research/) page.
