![Proportional symbol map showing gender and nationality of people who have traveled to space. Most of them are American men](images/2020-07-14-astronauts.png)

As part of the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/70f22df34ec00013b0b27bea143e871426638521/data/2020/2020-07-14/readme.md) project, I created this visualization of who has gone into space based on gender and nationality. This is my first attempt at mapping data geographically! I’m pretty pleased with how it turned out, but I would welcome any feedback. The code is available [here](https://github.com/jamesphare/tidy_tuesday/blob/main/scripts/2021-07-14-astronauts.R).
