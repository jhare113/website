![Map of modern renewable energy production in Europe](/post/2020-08-04-tidy-energy_files/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

I created this map of modern renewable (wind and solar) electricity generation in Europe as part of this week’s [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-08-04/readme.md). The source code is available [here](https://github.com/jamesphare/tidytuesday/blob/master/20200804/European-Energy.md).
