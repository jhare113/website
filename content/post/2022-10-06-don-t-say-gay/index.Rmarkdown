I wrote [an article on the current spate of "anti-woke" laws](https://rosalux.nyc/anti-woke-laws/) in the United States for the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung's New York office:

> For some socialists, this debate might seem like a distraction, an aspect of the culture wars pitting the neoliberal establishment against the Christian nationalist right, but these laws have real material consequences for the overwhelming majority of the working class who are women, people of color, or queer. For the moment, anti-woke forces are pushing their agenda through school boards, city halls, and state houses, so it is in these spaces---as well as in the streets---that leftists and liberals will need to fight back.
